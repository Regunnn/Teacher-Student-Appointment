Hi, Iam Rehan Khan. 

Due to technical problems and my low end laptop, I couldn't work on the project properly.
I have done the best I can with this project's architecture and design with basic styling but enough functionalities.
I have tried using firebase database, but due to lag in my laptop I couldn't work properly on the scalable project.
I have created the GitHub repo and uploaded the html, css and javascript codes(which only I was able to complete due to technical errors).
I have given the design architecture of the system in pdf format.



Execution
1. Web page starts with a login option for admin, teacher and student(index.html).
2. Press the required button.

3. If pressed admin- The admin portal will open(admin.html).
4. You will be able to login and then update or add teacher login details.

5. If pressed teacher- The teacher portal will open(teacher.html).
6. You will be able to login with the details and then will be able to accept incoming student appointment requests.

7. If pressed student- The student portal will open(student.html).
8. Login or Register with credentials and once entered you will be able to see a list of teachers with whom you can 
   book appointments if u wish to with that particular teacher.

9. These details can be considered as stored in the database as the service provided will work as if the details are getting stored.
10. The css styling is minimal but functionalities are extended to work as intended.

Note: Due to low end system, I had to reduce css styling so that js functionalities can be done without errors.
